# rkrv2
the next generation of rakarrack plugins

Rakarrack is a fork of zynaddsubfx to turn the effects of that synthesizer into a guitar effects processor. It rapidly became a renowned app in the linux audio world with over 40 different effects and a healthy number of presets.

However a decade later the typical workflow of a linux audio user changed from using JACK to route audio between standalone apps to using monolithic DAWS and plugin hosts with effects most commonly used only as plugins. Rakarrack's developers had moved on and the app simply stayed stagnant. Some effort was put into creating lv2 plugin ports for the rkrlv2 project, but that project was dedicated to keeping the interface and sound compatible with the original standalone app, in hopes of merging the two.

This project in contrast is meant to bring the effects to the current state of the art with proper parameter units, more consistent interfaces, and hopefully a better user experience.

We don't have a target schedule, we'd rather have something done well than just a hack (rkrlv2 already exists for that). We are very open to collaboration though to help accelerate things.
